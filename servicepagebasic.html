                        Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at 
                        Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control
                         56% of the stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial 
                         public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet
                          Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's Internet properties
                           and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who
                            became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.
